Our project is centered on interpreting sentiments from movie reviews. By using machine learning models and deep learning model and pretrained models, to know whether a review reflects a positive or negative sentiment. This knowledge is very important for movie makers. It helps them know how people feel about their movies and how to make better movies in the future.
